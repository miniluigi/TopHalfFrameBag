# TopHalfFrameBag
This is my first attempt at a frame bag - specifically the top half to integrate with the cranktank 3

I'm going to make the side panel in three distinct sections: top piece, zipper and gussets, and bottom piece (constructed of three panels). Because these are all going to cut, then sewen together I am going to oversize the whole panel and then recut in the laser.
I am also going to use seam sealer where possible.
